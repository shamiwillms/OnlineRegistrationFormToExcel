OnlineRegistrationFormToExcel
=============================

This is a simple program (mostly hacked together) that will read the xml from a Form Assmebly online form (using the xml output).

This takes the xml, reads it into memory and then outputs as excel spreadsheets for various purposes.

To run, just import project into Eclipse and run as a java application.  The xml file is hardcoded into the program.
